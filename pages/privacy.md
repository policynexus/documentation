# Objectives, Hacker Ethics, and GitHub Pages

Following the hacker ethics of the CCC, the principle is to "Use public data, protect private data." We adhere to this principle.

While we strive to make data from authorities, lobbying groups, etc., easily accessible, we handle your data as responsibly and sparingly as possible.

However, there is currently a flaw - because this documentation page is currently hosted on GitHub Pages in the USA. GitHub thus stores some data such as IP addresses about you on servers outside the EU.

We will change this before our actual web portal goes live.

# Web Host

This site is hosted by GitHub. GitHub stores user data such as IP addresses, date/time, browser, and similar in their access logs. However, these data are not accessible to the operators of this website.

GitHub's privacy policy is available here: [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/github/site-policy/github-privacy-statement)

In addition to the measures outlined in GitHub's privacy policy, the operators of `docs.example.de` do not use user tracking and do not analyze any user data.

# Cookies / Local Storage

On `docs.example.de`, we do not use cookies or local storage. However, other pages of `example.de` may use cookies if they are absolutely necessary for operation or for the realization of functions.

Other pages of `example.de` may handle this differently.

# Contact

If you use some kind of communication channel to get in touch, the usual data of the respective platform will be collected accordingly. You can find more detailed information from the respective providers.

If it concerns private messages, we will not disclose them to third parties. However, unencrypted messages can generally be read by the providers.
